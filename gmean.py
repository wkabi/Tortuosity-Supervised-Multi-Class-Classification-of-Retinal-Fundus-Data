    """Compute sensitivity, specificity, and support for each class

    The sensitivity is the ratio ``tp / (tp + fn)`` where ``tp`` is the number
    of true positives and ``fn`` the number of false negatives. The sensitivity
    quantifies the ability to avoid false negatives_[1].

    The specificity is the ratio ``tn / (tn + fp)`` where ``tn`` is the number
    of true negatives and ``fn`` the number of false negatives. The specificity
    quantifies the ability to avoid false positives_[1].

    The support is the number of occurrences of each class in ``y_true``.

    If ``pos_label is None`` and in binary classification, this function
    returns the average sensitivity and specificity if ``average``
    is one of ``'weighted'``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    y_true : ndarray, shape (n_samples, )
        Ground truth (correct) target values.

    y_pred : ndarray, shape (n_samples, )
        Estimated targets as returned by a classifier.

    labels : list, optional
        The set of labels to include when ``average != 'binary'``, and their
        order if ``average is None``. Labels present in the data can be
        excluded, for example to calculate a multiclass average ignoring a
        majority negative class, while labels not present in the data will
        result in 0 components in a macro average. For multilabel targets,
        labels are column indices. By default, all labels in ``y_true`` and
        ``y_pred`` are used in sorted order.

    pos_label : str or int, optional (default=1)
        The class to report if ``average='binary'`` and the data is binary.
        If the data are multiclass, this will be ignored;
        setting ``labels=[pos_label]`` and ``average != 'binary'`` will report
        scores for that label only.

    average : str or None, optional (default=None)
        If ``None``, the scores for each class are returned. Otherwise, this
        determines the type of averaging performed on the data:

        ``'binary'``:
            Only report results for the class specified by ``pos_label``.
            This is applicable only if targets (``y_{true,pred}``) are binary.
        ``'micro'``:
            Calculate metrics globally by counting the total true positives,
            false negatives and false positives.
        ``'macro'``:
            Calculate metrics for each label, and find their unweighted
            mean.  This does not take label imbalance into account.
        ``'weighted'``:
            Calculate metrics for each label, and find their average, weighted
            by support (the number of true instances for each label). This
            alters 'macro' to account for label imbalance; it can result in an
            F-score that is not between precision and recall.
        ``'samples'``:
            Calculate metrics for each instance, and find their average (only
            meaningful for multilabel classification where this differs from
            :func:`accuracy_score`).
    warn_for : tuple or set, for internal use
        This determines which warnings will be made in the case that this
        function is being used to return only one of its metrics.

    sample_weight : ndarray, shape (n_samples, )
        Sample weights.

    Returns
    -------
    sensitivity : float (if ``average`` = None) or ndarray, \
        shape (n_unique_labels, )

    specificity : float (if ``average`` = None) or ndarray, \
        shape (n_unique_labels, )

    support : int (if ``average`` = None) or ndarray, \
        shape (n_unique_labels, )
        The number of occurrences of each label in ``y_true``.

    """Compute the geometric mean

    The geometric mean (G-mean) is the root of the product of class-wise
    sensitivity. This measure tries to maximize the accuracy on each of the
    classes while keeping these accuracies balanced. For binary classification
    G-mean is the squared root of the product of the sensitivity
    and specificity. For multi-class problems it is a higher root of the
    product of sensitivity for each class.

    For compatibility with other imbalance performance measures, G-mean can be
    calculated for each class separately on a one-vs-rest basis when
    ``average != 'multiclass'``.

    The best value is 1 and the worst value is 0. Traditionally if at least one
    class is unrecognized by the classifier, G-mean resolves to zero. To
    alleviate this property, for highly multi-class the sensitivity of
    unrecognized classes can be "corrected" to be a user specified value
    (instead of zero). This option works only if ``average == 'multiclass'``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    y_true : ndarray, shape (n_samples, )
        Ground truth (correct) target values.

    y_pred : ndarray, shape (n_samples, )
        Estimated targets as returned by a classifier.

    labels : list, optional
        The set of labels to include when ``average != 'binary'``, and their
        order if ``average is None``. Labels present in the data can be
        excluded, for example to calculate a multiclass average ignoring a
        majority negative class, while labels not present in the data will
        result in 0 components in a macro average.

    pos_label : str or int, optional (default=1)
        The class to report if ``average='binary'`` and the data is binary.
        If the data are multiclass, this will be ignored;
        setting ``labels=[pos_label]`` and ``average != 'binary'`` will report
        scores for that label only.

    average : str or None, optional (default=``'multiclass'``)
        If ``None``, the scores for each class are returned. Otherwise, this
        determines the type of averaging performed on the data:

        ``'binary'``:
            Only report results for the class specified by ``pos_label``.
            This is applicable only if targets (``y_{true,pred}``) are binary.
        ``'micro'``:
            Calculate metrics globally by counting the total true positives,
            false negatives and false positives.
        ``'macro'``:
            Calculate metrics for each label, and find their unweighted
            mean.  This does not take label imbalance into account.
        ``'weighted'``:
            Calculate metrics for each label, and find their average, weighted
            by support (the number of true instances for each label). This
            alters 'macro' to account for label imbalance; it can result in an
            F-score that is not between precision and recall.
        ``'samples'``:
            Calculate metrics for each instance, and find their average (only
            meaningful for multilabel classification where this differs from
            :func:`accuracy_score`).

    sample_weight : ndarray, shape (n_samples, )
        Sample weights.

    correction: float, optional (default=0.0)
        Substitutes sensitivity of unrecognized classes from zero to a given
        value.
